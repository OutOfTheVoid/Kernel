QMFS: Quick Memory File System
==============================

The QMFS is a pre-allocated uncompressed file system
intended for use as a ram-disk in kernels. It allows
for fast access to on-ram files in a quick but safe
format, which should be easily compatible with most
kernel file systems.

The file system exists in contiguous memory, such 
that it can be represented as a set of C langauge 
structures which may enumerate and measure files and
folders using integers and variables.

The beginning of this spec defines the structure of
the file system header, which resides at memory
offset 0 on the disk or virtual disk that it resides
opon.

Below is the definition of the structure of the
header:

header_t:
{
	
	uchar8 signature : 'q', 'm', 'f', 's', '.', 's',
		'i', 'g';
	
	// This field makes up the first 8 bytes of the
	// header, which should always be equal to
	// "qmfs.sig"
	
	uchar32 root_dir_offset;
	
	// This field represents the offset of the fs's
	// root direcory structure
	
	uchar32 checksum;
	
	// This field represents a checksum such that 
	// when you add the first 16 bytes (in groups
	// of 4) they should total 0.
	
}
